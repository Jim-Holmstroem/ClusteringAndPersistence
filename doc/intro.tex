\section{introduction}
    The big goal for this lecture series is to understand metrics by
    searching for a metric between metric spaces.
    This has been proven to be impossible (ref), but dispite the lack of a
    grand metric of metrics we can still try to search within (common word for
    ultrametrics, barcodes etc) to at least get a grasp on certain parts.
